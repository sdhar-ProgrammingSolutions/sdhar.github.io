The codebase is completely written using modern C++ constructs and following the C++14 standard. We are expected to have at least 85% of Unit Test coverage.

                <li>I am a part of the Global Team working to provide an interface to the customers to integrate 3rd Party devices on to the QTMS
                  seamlessly without intervention from the Engineering department. The Devices could connect to various protocols like
                  MODBUS, IEC61850 and DNP3 and provide outbound connections with the same protocols. My role is to develop applications
                  for the device which will be utilized by the customer to get the required sensor information.</li>
                <li>My work primarily involves creating the C++ Backend application to add a sensor dynamically so that we get the outbound
                  sensor information through IEC61850. Before implementing this feature, I have been working on refactoring the old legacy code
                  written in C and converting it out using the modern C++17 constructs along with writing Unit Tests (using Google Test
                  Framework) to validate code changes. This was a gigantic task to organize 4000 lines of code into systematic classes and files and
                  then forming a method to dynamically integrate the sensor.</li>
                <li>My new application is organized using design principles (Factory, Builder and Strategy patterns) and modern C++ constructs (STL Libraries, Standard Algorithms, Regex etc). This is written keeping in mind that whoever maintains the code in the future will be at complete ease to understand the code. Along with this, I have designed several libraries to facilitate the work of my teammates.</li>
